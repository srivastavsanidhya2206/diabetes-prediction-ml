# diabetes-prediction-ml
Developed during my Summer Internship at IIT Patna, this project focuses on predicting diabetes using clinical health data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and training an SVM-based machine learning model for accurate classification. The project highlights practical implementation of end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
