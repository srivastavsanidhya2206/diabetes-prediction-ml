#  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning:

This project was developed during my **Summer Internship at IIT Patna** and focuses on
predicting whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using clinical health parameters.

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline was implemented, including data preprocessing,
feature scaling using **StandardScaler**, and training a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
classifier for accurate prediction.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling for balanced learning
- SVM-based classification model
- Real-world healthcare dataset
- Single-user input prediction

## Tech Stack:
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab
