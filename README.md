Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning:

This project was developed during my **Summer Internship at IIT Patna**.
The objective of this project is to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic
using clinical health parameters.

The dataset was preprocessed and standardized using feature scaling, and a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was trained and evaluated for accurate prediction.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
